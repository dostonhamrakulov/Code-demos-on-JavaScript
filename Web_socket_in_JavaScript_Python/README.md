# Working with Sockets & WebSockets

There are two files:
* Not_splited_Engine_control.html file which contains Enginee Control with the power of WebSocket
* Engine.html and Control.html files which contains Enginee and control with WebSocket.

The task was to split Not_splited_Engine_control.html into two "Engine.html and Control.html" so that we are able to control Engine.html with Control.html using WebSocket.

### Implemented the following functionality using WebSockets:

* Split the example page into two separate HTML files.
* One should only contain the slider to control the speed and the other only the engine visualization.
* The user shall still be able to control the engine with the separated slider.
* Therefore, you need to implement a WebSocket server as well as the client side functi
